# PET
Asymmetry Index pipeline for evaluation of epilepsy
v2.0 (Feb 2025)

Custom scripts by Anton Fomenko MD FRCSC
Epilepsy Neurosurgery Fellow, University of Toronto

Branch: Dmitri Å astin
Epilepsy Neurosurgery Fellow, University of Toronto

### REQUIREMENTS:

1. MATLAB v2017 or higher

2. SPM12 toolbox https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/

3. Exported PET, T1 MRI, and FLAIR MRI sequences of the patient (in NIFTI or DICOM)

4. Scripts attached to this repository.

5. Optional but desirable: MRIcron viewer  https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron

6. Approximately 1 hour to run the full pipeline on a personal laptop. Dedicated desktop machines will perform faster


### GUIDELINE FOR USE:

1. Download the repository. Ensure MATLAB and SPM12 are installed.

2. Export PET, T1 MRI, FLAIR MRI scans of patients. Ideally the scans are done within the same year, and are thinly sliced. 

3. Consider cropping the images to contain brain only if excessive neck is present (may help registration).

4. PET images will come as "PET" or "NACPET". Choose the "PET" one, as this is attenuation corrected.

5. Note this branch is only tested with NIFTI files (DICOM may or may not run). The advantage is that the correct modalities are manually labelled.

6. Create an inputs JSON as demonstrated below. **This file is mandatory.**

7. Run asymmetry_index_wrapper.m and with a string containing the path to your JSON as input.

8. If an individual step needs to be re-run, the output folder will contain `params_step_*.mat` files with inputs for every step. This is particularly helpful for experimenting with different Z-score and/or cluster volume thresholds, in which case Step5 can be repeated with a different `thr` and/or `cluster_size` setting, respectively, in very little time.


### CREATING INPUTS JSON:

Create a text file and enter the following (could be later renamed to .json):

```
{
  "PET": "path\to\PET\nifti\or\NIFTI_or_DCM_dir",
  "T1": "path\to\T1\nifti\or\NIFTI_or_DCM_dir",
  "FLAIR": "path\to\FLAIR\nifti\or\NIFTI_or_DCM_dir",
  "output_dir": "path\to\output_dir"
}
```

These are the required inputs that should always be present. In addition, the following are optional (contain within the same curly brackets):

```
  "centre_of_mass": 1,
  "thr": 3,
  "cluster_size": 0.1,
  "report": 1,
  "blanks": 1,
  "regions": 0, 
  "burnin": 0,
  "viz": 1
```

- `centre_of_mass` lets registration initialise from the centres of mass of both images. This helps when e.g. PET is wildly out of alignment, and so it is strongly recommended by default (unless all images are pre-registered). Valid values: 0&nbsp;/&nbsp;1.
- `thr` is the minimum Z-score for the PET asymmetry to be demonstrated on outputs. Valid values: any non-negative number.
- `cluster_size`: threshold for cluster size in cc. Clusters smaller that this threshold will get discarded, unless they contain Z peak which will always be preserved. Valid values: any non-negative number.
- `report`: produce a report which will contain per-cluster images and data. Valid values: 0&nbsp;/&nbsp;1.
- `blanks`: given `report` is on, will append empty fields that can be populated with clinical data. Valid values: 0&nbsp;/&nbsp;1.
- `regions`: given `report` is on, will attempt an automated anatomical description of every cluster. Experimental feature, always double-check! Valid values: 0&nbsp;/&nbsp;1.
- `burnin`: whether output burn-in image is produced. This will modify the original T1-weighted image such that Z>3 clusters are shown as white, Z>4 clusters are shown as black, Z>5 clusters are shown as grey. The file is saved as `burnin.nii`. Valid values: 0&nbsp;/&nbsp;1.
- `viz` provides interactive quality control of the relevant steps - it is recommended to inspect the interim and final outputs to ensure the correctness of results. Valid values: 0&nbsp;/&nbsp;1.

Any of these optional flags can be omitted, in which case they will default to the values shown above.
All of these flags are present in `example_inputs.json` provided with the code; this can be copied for each set of data and modified accordingly.

### VIEWING RESULTS 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/987a5f85-21a7-4577-90c3-9b2f703ef9be)

Results are automatically shown at the end, but to view them separately, `view_PET_AI.m` should be used:

1. One option is to type `view_PET_AI(params)` where `params` is loaded in advance from the output folder's `params_step_5.mat` file. 
2. The other option is to copy the viewer file into the output folder, navigate there in Matlab, and type `view_PET_AI()`.

**NOTE! The viewer will demonstrate results in "anatomical" orientation (right is right, left is left). The cluster image files (.nii), however, will stay aligned with the original T1w image file.**

### EDITING THE REPORT

Report is produced as HTML and image files, stored in the `report` folder of the output directory. This is more flexible than generating a Microsoft Word document with Matlab directly. The HTML file can be subsequently opened with Microsoft Word, edited as needed (e.g., populating with clinical data), and stored as a document file or exported as a PDF. Note that thus produced .doc(x) file will not have the images embedded (just linked) - so once the report is finished, it is recommended to save the final version in PDF format.

### EXPORTING RESULTS TO DICOM:

Open output in MRIcron to ensure burned-in is adequate of new nifti. 

1. To use in BrainLab/NeuroMate planning station must EXPORT `burnin.nii` AS DICOM 
2. Use 3Dslicer --> Module> DICOM  --> EXPORT as DICOM series --> Populate tag fields.
3. You should now have a folder of DICOMs ready for use. Can put this on USB stick and use on planning software (Brainlab, Stealth, Neuromate). **It must be noted that any such use is purely experimental.**
